I've come to expect so much from #GOT that the latest episode left me a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong it was good, great even but just not as good as I was hoping. #GameofThrones #TheLongNight	sadness	PESSIMISTIC	OTHER	2.6121264
It's horrible, but at least it's not as horrible as it could have been. It looked as though we were going to lose the entire cathedral last night. I heard the three rose windows and the Pieta were saved. Kudos to the firefighters: https://t.co/xDDSoARKVV #NotreDameCathedralFire	sadness	PESSIMISTIC	OTHER	2.611204
USER I came to #America leaving a country like #Venezuela. After we left, people stood in lone for cooking oil, rice, water, soap, kerosene, gas. This is what the progressive left is leading us to. They don’t see it from this view point but by the time they see it - it’s too late.	sadness	PESSIMISTIC	OTHER	2.6062903
USER_Monty Honestly, it’s kinda stupid that #Endgame and #Gameofthrones are probably the 2 biggest film/tv events of the year and I can’t discuss it freely because people haven’t seen it lol.	sadness	PESSIMISTIC	OTHER	2.604205

1/3: I have been quiet about the #NotreDameCathedralFire because I’m been feeling despair and anger.

It is secondary how #NotreDame could burn.

Hot take on #NotreDameCathedralFire   People are out here acting like they’ve been long time stans and like their world is crumbling because of this fire. Yes, it’s unfortunate.
